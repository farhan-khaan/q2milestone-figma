            When we started Avion, the idea was simple. Make high-quality furniture affordable and available to the mass
            market.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Handmade, and lovingly crafted furniture and homewares is what we live, breathe and design in our studio. Today,
            weâ€™ve grown into a global brand and are bringing the Avion experience to homes everywhere.
